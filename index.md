I'm a third-year CS PhD student at Georgia Tech's School of Interactive Computing.
I study user privacy and social cybersecurity and am co-advised by Sauvik Das and Keith Edwards. Specifically, I'm interested in large-scale group privacy and collective action. Talk to me about people-powered privacy policies and consumer data unions!

Previously, I worked at the DNC  as an analytics manager on the Mobilization team.  I designed  behavioral experiments for and modeled grassroots fundraising and voter  outreach via email, SMS, and direct mail.

I received my M.S. in computational analysis and  public policy from the University of Chicago in 2018, and my B.A. in economics and business from University College London in 2015.
