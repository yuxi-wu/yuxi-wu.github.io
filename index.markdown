# hi, i'm yuxi.
<br/>

I'm a third-year computer science PhD student at Georgia Tech's School of Interactive Computing, studying human-computer interaction and computer-supported cooperative work.  I specialize in user privacy and social cybersecurity,  Specifically, I'm interested in collective action for end-user privacy:

* what motivates people to participate in collective empathy
* how people unite on demands for redress from big bad privacy-violating institutions
* and how to realize these desires.

I conduct mixed-methods research on designing for such action.  I love surveys and interviewing!

I am co-advised by [Sauvik Das](https://sauvikdas.com/) and [Keith Edwards](https://faculty.cc.gatech.edu/~keith/).
