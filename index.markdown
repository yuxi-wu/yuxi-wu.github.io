# hi, i'm yuxi.
<br/>

I'm a PhD candidate in computer science at Georgia Tech's School of Interactive Computing, studying human-computer interaction and computer-supported cooperative work.  I specialize in user privacy and social cybersecurity.  

Specifically, I'm interested in collective action for end-user privacy:

* what motivates people to participate in collective empathy
* how people unite on demands for redress from big bad privacy-violating institutions
* and how to realize these desires.

I conduct mixed-methods research on such action through creating design probes and design fiction.  I love surveys and interviewing.

I am co-advised by [Sauvik Das](https://sauvikdas.com/) and [Keith Edwards](https://faculty.cc.gatech.edu/~keith/).  My research is supported by a Georgia Tech President's Fellowship and a JP Morgan Chase AI Research Fellowship.

***I'm on the academic job market this year, looking for tenure-track faculty positions!***
