# hi, i'm yuxi.
<br/>

I am a [**Distinguished Postdoctoral Research Fellow**](https://www.khoury.northeastern.edu/research/postdoctoral-fellowship/) at **Northeastern University's Khoury College of Computer Sciences**.

My work sits at the intersection of **usable privacy and security, human-computer interaction, and design**, via a lens of critical theory.  Specifically, I design collaborative and social systems that help people with privacy and security problems respond to their harms.  In my research, I aim to empower people to collectively respond to institutional privacy harms (e.g., online behavioral advertising, data breaches, surveillance, etc.) and demand accountability, mitigations, or reparations for those harms.  I conduct mixed-methods research on such collective action through creating design probes and design fiction; I also love surveys and interviewing.

I recently earned my **PhD in Computer Science** from **Georgia Tech's School of Interactive Computing**, where I studied human-computer interaction and computer-supported cooperative work under the co-advisement of [Sauvik Das](https://sauvikdas.com/) and [Keith Edwards](https://faculty.cc.gatech.edu/~keith/).  My research has been supported by a Georgia Tech President's Fellowship and a JP Morgan Chase AI Research Fellowship.
