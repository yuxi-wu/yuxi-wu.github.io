# about
<br/>

Previously, I worked at the DNC as an analytics manager on the Mobilization team. I designed behavioral experiments for and modeled grassroots fundraising and voter outreach via email, SMS, and direct mail.

### fun
I'm a hobbyist [photographer](https://www.instagram.com/yuxitoo/), runner, and hiker-sometimes-backpacker, all at varying degrees of questionable quality.  I enjoy lugging a 5lb, 50-year-old camera up mountains.
